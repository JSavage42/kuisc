## To Edit

To change officers edit the `/config/officers.js` **ONLY**. The javascript will handle the rest.

Be sure to name the headshots accordingly.

## Naming Conventions

To add or replace an officer rename their photo to [law/edw]-title.[jpg/png]. You may have to change `/config/pics.js` to edit the extension.
