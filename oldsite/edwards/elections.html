              I’m Madi Schulte, current Communications Chair for the Edwards
              Campus Jayhackers. I work as an Intern at KUMC's Office of
              Information Security and previously worked at KU's IT Security
              Office in Lawrence. Before I started taking classes at the Edwards
              Campus, I had attended a few club meetings in Lawrence. I've been
              working at and attending KU since 2015 and only after joining
              BSIT/Jayhackers did I really start to make friends and feel more
              comfortable on campus. I want to make sure that others have a
              similar, welcoming experience when they join the BSIT program and
              if they do decide to join our club.

              I am also interested in online/cyber security. A few other hobbies
              I have are mountain biking, kickin' it with my corgi, and playing

            <p>
              Hello, my name is Matthew Loo. I am a senior in the BSIT program
              with over 4 years of professional experience in IT at various
              companies such as Dell Technologies, EMC, Coca-Cola, QTS Data
              Centers, and Kansas City Southern Railroad and am currently an
              Information Security Engineer at Wells Fargo Bank. My professional
              certifications include multiple Splunk administration and
              architectural certifications and multiple Cisco networking
              certifications as well. As a member of the KUISC “Jayhackers”, I
              have participated in two competitions, one of which as the team
              captain, both resulting in a third place finishes. As the current
              Chief Technology Officer of the Edwards Campus chapter, I have
              also assisted the club by providing expertise and instruction
              during hands-on labs and competition set-up phases as well as
              delivering presentations during meetings involving data analytics,
              machine learning, and automation and their involvement in security
              threat response. Additionally, in cooperation with my other group
              members (all of which are also nominated for officer positions
              this election), my capstone project will hopefully result in the
              second iteration of the “High Score” cyber defense competition, a
              KU hosted CDC designed to introduce local high school students to
              competitions. Outside of the Jayhackers, I have also participated
              in Splunk’s “Boss of the SOC”, a security threat hunting
              competition involving Splunk’s Enterprise Security and User
              Behavior Analytics platforms in conjunction with Phantom
              automation tools and also regularly participate in Wells Fargo
              security training competitions as well, most recently vs. the US
              Naval Academy. In my free time I enjoy exploring a wide range of
              security related concepts involving steganography, cryptography,
              penetration testing, and system hardening.

              I am Elly Richardson, and I am currently a Senior majoring in
              Information Technology. My interests are software development,
              systems engineering, and information security. I always wanted to
              be good at security, one of the main reasons I picked IT as my
              major, and is the reason I joined this club. I would like to be a
              DevOps Software Engineer someday as I am interested in developing
              applications and also manage systems they are running in. I am
              very disciplined in managing my time and I believe I can be a good
              officer.

              My name is Patrick Moeller, and I am a student in the BSIT Program
              at KU. Computers have fascinated me ever since I was young, and I
              love the creativity they can spark within people. The moment I
              figured out how to get a computer to do what I wanted was the
              moment that changed my life, and inspired me to learn as much as I
              could about how to do more. That inspiration remains as strong as
              ever, and I aspire to be a world-class software developer and
              all-around IT professional.

              have participated in one competition. Writing has always been one
              of my strong suites, and If you make me your scribe I will take
              diligent notes of the meeting as well as look for opportunities to
              expand the position to encompass more responsibilities.

              I am Matt Bysfield. I have returned to KU to change careers to
              something that I enjoy more and hopefully has more
              earning/learning potential. I say frequently that there is so much
              to learn regarding I.T. that I will never feel like I will know it
              all. Currently I work full time for the Johnson County Department
              of Health and Environment doing Child Care Licensing visits. I
              have also worked in Mental Health and Child Protective Services. I
              have always had an interest in I.T. and kick myself for not going
              that route the first time I was at KU. I got involved with the
              Jayhackers last year at the end of the Spring semester and
              participated in the CANSEC event at K-State last fall. That was a
              fun experience, but opened up my eyes to how much more I could
              learn. As of right now, I am aspiring to get into Information
              Security Management when I graduate with my BSIT degree in
              December 2019. Outside of school and work (which is little), I
              enjoy driving my Jeep and taking it to places that most people
              can't get to, spending time with my wife and 3 year old son, and
              Sporting KC.

              my resume. I have not spent as much time with the Jayhackers as I
              would have liked, but I hope that changes this year. I promise to
              use our funds to send our teams to competitions and to buy us lots

              I currently work with KU Student Housing as a Resident Assistant

              After I graduate in May I hope to be working in the healthcare
